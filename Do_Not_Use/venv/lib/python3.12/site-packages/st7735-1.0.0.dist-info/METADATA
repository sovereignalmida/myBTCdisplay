Python library to control an ST7735 TFT LCD display. Allows simple drawing on the display without installing a kernel module.

Designed specifically to work with a ST7735 based 160x80 pixel TFT SPI display. (Specifically the 0.96" SPI LCD from Pimoroni).

## Installing

````
pip install st7735
````

See example of usage in the examples folder.

# Licensing & History

This library is a modification of a modification of code originally written by Tony DiCola for Adafruit Industries, and modified to work with the ST7735 by Clement Skau.

It has been modified by Pimoroni to include support for their 160x80 SPI LCD breakout, and hopefully also generalised enough so that it will support other ST7735-powered displays.

## Modifications include:

* PIL/Pillow has been removed from the underlying display driver to separate concerns- you should create your own PIL image and display it using `display(image)`
* `width`, `height`, `rotation`, `invert`, `offset_left` and `offset_top` parameters can be passed into `__init__` for alternate displays
* `Adafruit_GPIO` has been replaced with `RPi.GPIO` and `spidev` to closely align with our other software (IE: Raspberry Pi only)
* Test fixtures have been added to keep this library stable
